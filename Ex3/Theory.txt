Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN or ConvNet) are complex feed forward neural networks. CNNs are used for image classification and recognition because of its high accuracy.
In normal Feed forward neural network: the RGB image have 64x64x3 so it need 64x64x3 nodes in input layer => so large 

the architecture have:
Convolutional layer : The objective of the Convolution Operation is to extract the high-level features such as edges, from the input image

There are two types of results to the operation — one in which the convolved feature is reduced in dimensionality as compared to the input, 
and the other in which the dimensionality is either increased or remains the same. 
This is done by applying Valid Padding in case of the former, or Same Padding in the case of the latter.

Pooling layer is responsible for reducing the spatial size of the Convolved Feature 
	This is to decrease the computational power required to process the data through dimensionality reduction. 
	Furthermore, it is useful for extracting dominant features which are rotational and positional invariant, thus maintaining the process of effectively training of the model.
	There are two types of Pooling: Max Pooling and Average Pooling. Max Pooling returns the maximum value from the portion of the image covered by the Kernel. 
	On the other hand, Average Pooling returns the average of all the values from the portion of the image covered by the Kernel

we are going to flatten the final output and feed it to a regular Neural Network for classification purposes.   ra ma tran m*1
